# **App Name**: Strategist Systemsâ„¢ Cockpit

## Core Features:

- Tiered Access Login: Welcome users and allow them to select their access tier (Observer, Advisor, or Elite).
- Mutation Dashboard: Display live mutation cards with performance stats, fill accuracy, ROI arcs, and signal ancestry.
- Mutation Generator: Enable users to propose new mutations by setting ROI targets and entropy risk.
- Rationale Narration: Use Gemini to summarize the strategist's decision-making logic for each mutation, including a clarity score. The tool should decide what information to include.
- Cognition Graph UI: Render a visual graph of the strategist's cognition, displaying nodes, edges, override forks, and entropy triggers. Graph can be configured using simple text prompts.
